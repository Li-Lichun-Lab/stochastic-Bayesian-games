LP formulas of two-player zero-sum stochastic Bayesian games

Two-player zero-sum Bayesian games are dynamic games where two players play against each other for several stages. Sometimes, they will play against each other forever. In this game, every player has its own private information (which is also called the private state), say 'k' for player 1 (maximizer) and 'l' for player 2 (minimizer). At every stage, the players need to take some action based on the information they have, and the one-stage payoff is decided by both payers' actions and private states. The game is player for several stages. When the game evolves to the next stage, the player's private states will change according to a Markovian rule based on the current private states and the current actions of both players. If we want to benefit from long time behavior, greedly 

As the maximizer, player 1 aimes to maximize the overall payoff summed up over all stages, while Player 2 wants to minimize it.   This private information will change stage by stage according to some Markovian rule based on the current private states and the
